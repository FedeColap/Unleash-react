This repo works with the  [Unleas server](https://github.com/FedeColap/unleash-server).

# Welcome to Unleash
This app has been created using React, Node.js and PostgreSQL.

It's a blog where you can create, update and delete thoughts about some happenings in your life.

You must be registered and comply to the Code of counduct in order to access the community.

The landing page features an external API call to get a daily joke (so it will retrieve the same joke for the whole day).

Below the daily joke there is a section where you can "f* word" a person, not stored in memory *we don't want to leave evidence, after all ;-)*
